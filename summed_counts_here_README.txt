this is the only time in the more formal analysis that i have summed the two datasets into one- 
i hadnt done it before because it was very similar and there may be unintentional issues
associated with summing without accounting for that summing
i have run the same analysis with the combined, summed count tables into one
and have got out very similar results

therefore, i have done this as a proof of concept that the combined dataset is not required

there is no additional information gained

and with not combining the data in the formal paper, we avoid any potential issues with summing
with no statistical accounting for doing so

** Further, i have done estimate sequencing saturation (can be seen in the 'final matrix' folder) in which the all groups have reached sequencing saturation based on random sampling. Therefore I am confident with one sequencing run, we have reached all the conclusions we can

Especially as we are looking at significantly expressed genes, and large significant differences - we are not looking at neuanced changes, as with the cohort this would not be possible anyway

With the sample type, and cohort design, there does not seem a reasonable reason for incorporating two matrices. Information gained from one sample is enough. 

The first sequencing run was used for analysis.
